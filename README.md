Island Generator is my Senior Capstone Project for my CSCI degree at UNC Asheville. This project is a tool to procedurally generate 3D islands for use in games, renders, animations, etc. The generation settings menu allows for some control over how the island generates. For more in depth control, such as settings for specific biomes, props, etc, download and tweak the project itself. This is also required in order to export the generated island as a fbx for import into other software.
